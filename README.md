# boagDev

a page of things, to replace the page of things that doesnt really have enough things for my liking

will use .tsx/vite to build it, and some custom react hooks and components where necessary

## what?

a modular portfolio designed for evolution

components are built to be extended and reused as ideas evolve

## yeah?

yeah

built modular; built to last; a portfolio that grows with new ideas


### why tho

it's really just an excuse to play with some cool webdev toys, maybe try out some silly ideas on the way


#### what if i fork it 

as long as you attribute, and tell me what you did? then heck yeah, have fun!

feel free to ask if you have any questions
