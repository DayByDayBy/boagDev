# boagDev

a page of things, to replace the page of things that doesnt have enough things for my liking

will use .tsx/vite to build it, and some custom react hooks and components where necessary

## why tho

it's really just an excuse to play with some cool webdev toys, maybe try out some silly ideas on the way
