# boagDev

boagDev - a developer who scales with ideas

a page of things, to replace the page of things that doesnt have enough things for my liking

will use .tsx/vite to build it, and some custom react hooks and components where necessary

## what?

a modular portfolio designed for evolution

components are built to be extended and reused as ideas grow



### why tho

it's really just an excuse to play with some cool webdev toys, maybe try out some silly ideas on the way
